                   (can be used for docker linux system)

# Full Resolution Mode

You can download full resolution image of JPG, GIF, PNG files by specifying --full true

# Data Imbalance Detection

Detects data imbalance based on the number of files.

When crawling ends, the message shows you what directory has under 50% of average files.

I recommend you to remove those directories and re-download.


# Remote crawling through SSH on your server

```
sudo apt-get install xvfb <- This is virtual display

sudo apt-get install screen <- This will allow you to close SSH terminal while running.

screen -S s1

Xvfb :99 -ac & DISPLAY=:99 python3 main.py
```

# Customize

You can make your own crawler by changing collect_links.py

# Issues

As google site consistently changes, please make issues if it doesn't work.
